# tiny-dqn

A very short & simple python implementation of Deep Q Networks using TensorFlow and OpenAI gym. This program learns to play MsPacman. With very little change it could be made to learn just about any other Atari game.

It is based on the 2013 paper by V. Mnih _et al._, "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning": [arXiv:1312.5602](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf).

The Q-networks (actor and critic) have 3 convolutional layers and two fully connected layers (including the output layer). This code implements a replay memory and É›-greedy policy for exploration.

= Requirements

* OpenAI gym + dependencies for the Atari environment ([installation instructions](https://github.com/openai/gym#installation))
* TensorFlow ([installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html))
* Numpy (`pip install numpy`)

= Usage

    python tiny_dqn.py --iterations 100000

Saves the model to `my_dqn.ckpt`. To view it in action, run:

    python tiny_dqn.py --iterations 100000 --render

For more options:

    python tiny_dqn.py --help

This is a draft, I have not had the time to test it seriously yet. If you find any issue, please contact me or send a Pull Request.

Enjoy!
